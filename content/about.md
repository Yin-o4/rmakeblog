This Hugo theme was ported from [
Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), 
a minimalist website generator built in Python. 
I don't have time to document this theme. You 
have to read the source code to understand what 
it can do. All I can say for now is that I love it. It is clean, minimal, and responsive.

I hope you will enjoy this theme. The source code is 
[on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). 
Happy hacking!
